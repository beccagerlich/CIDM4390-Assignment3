# Description

There a few basic skills you need to review/relearn/learn about the primary application development framework we'll be using - ASP.NET MVC Core 3.1.  All tutorials assume/expect that you are using Visual Studio Code.

As such, I am asking you to complete the following tutorials and submit them here and to your Github repository.  I expect that you'll maintain a SINGLE Github repository for all of your coding materials.
